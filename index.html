            <h5>to my first student's portfolio. It was prepared for a 1 semester exam. During the first
                semester at KEA INT Multimedia Design I did several projects. I was taught how to work in
                group. I achieved skills that I never would have dreamed about. I am really glad that I attend at this course.</h5>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <h5>My decision to come to Denmark was unexpected, in one day I packed all my belongings, quit my job and ran away. Bold decision and it gave me a lot of joy but I'm still asking my self if it was a good call. I really hope that in the future I will be able to say - oh yeah, it was. Beside studying at KEA I am really intrested in Graphic Design. I come from Poland, and I admire Polish Posters from 90's. I think design is really a part of my life at this moment and I don't want it to change. To this portfolio website I attach my resume. <a href=cv.html class=a1> <h5>Mikolaj Wojciechowski - CV</h5></a></h5>
