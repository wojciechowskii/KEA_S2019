            <h5>to my first student's portfolio. I have prepared it for the first exam after my first semester at KEA. During the this
                semester at Multimedia Design program, I have made several projects. I was taught how to work in
                group and how to cooperate with people of different backgrounds. I have achieved skills that were unexpected and and honestly, surprised me in a positive way. I am really satisfied with the program I attend to. </h5>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <h5>My decision to come to Denmark was very sudden, one day I packed all of my belongings, quit my job and moved out. This bold decision gave me a lot of satisfaction but I am still asking my self if it was a good call. I really hope that in the future I will be able to say - oh yeah, it was. Beside studying at KEA I am truly intrested in Graphic Design. As you may know, I come from Poland and my favourite style is the one that Polish Posters from 90's present. I think design is a part of my life and at this moment and I do not want it to change. By clicking this link you will be able to see my CV attached to this portfolio. <a href=cv.html class=a1>
