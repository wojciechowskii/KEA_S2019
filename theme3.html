        <h2>Team Canvas</h2>
        <h5>Unfortunately during the assigment 03.02 I was absent. I was in Poland due to the family problems. Becouse of that I haven't done the assigment. I will try to demonstrate the requirements using examples from diffrent projects. <br>
            Presented Team Canvas is from the latest project we have done. Team Canvas helped us as a team to reach our goal. It was super easy becouse of the thing we wrote in there. It helped us out with implanting the tasks.</h5>

        <h2>Story board</h2>
        <h5>Presented story board is also taken from the lates assigment about the Native App.
            As a group we prepared the application that would help organising the KEA Global Week. We came up with many amazing ideas during this project but we needed to put them on the paper. That is why we prepared this story board. It was really helpfull to work with it, becouse it lets you focuse on the main goal and reach it. Story board it's a thing that I will implement in our future projects.

        <h2>Prototype in XD</h2>
        <h5>Prototype that you can see right now is taken from the Design Sprint. Goal of the project was to "Make students life easier". To reach that goal we prepared a better version of a Fronter which is a platform for Students and Teachers. After brainstorm we came with many ideas, we created a story board and after that we made it real with XD. Prototyping with XD lets you visualise the final product before you code it. It helps you to find the weak spots in the design and user experience flow. I have never worked with XD before I started my studies at KEA, but right now I really apreciate this program. You will find the link to full XD prototype below.
