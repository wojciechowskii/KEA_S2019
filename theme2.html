        <h2>The idea about the movie</h2>
        <h5>In theme 2, I have worked in a group and our task was to create a Interactive Production
            based on a chosen movie. Our choice was a "Taxi Driver" directed by Martin Scorsese.
            This movie is a huge classic so working with it was a pleasure. It was our first group project and it was quite challenging. Our ideas and perspecives were diffrent but we all agreed about the intro to our production. We wanted to to create a short intro movie so we met one Wendesday in order to make it. We rented a car from "Drive now" app and bought smoke bombs for a special effect. It was a simple plan but implementation was not as simple. After three hours we have finally made it, and we were so proud of it. Moreover, we have managed to make some pictures and later we created the animations from them. Working in this group was a challenging, but good experience. You can see our final production from the link below.</h5>

        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <h5>The final stage of assigment was the presentation. Each group created a small space for
            presenting their work. My task was to design the poster and then to hang in on the wall, so that the people know what we have created for our Interactive Production. Unfortunately when I went to the printing station it was closed. Luckly, Nina created a graffiti with a title of our movie. If you missed our presentation we also have prepared a PDF with process of creating the production. </h5>
