        <h2>The idea about the movie</h2>
        <h5>In theme 2, I worked in a group and our task was to create a Interactive Production
            based on one chosen movie. Our choice was a "Taxi Driver" directed by Martin Scorsese.
            This movie is a huge classic so working with it was a pleasure. It was our first group project and it was really challenging. Our ideas were diffrent but we all agreed about the intro to our production. The idea was to create a really short intro movie, so we meet on Wendesday to make it. We rented a car from the "Drive now" and bought smoke bombs. It was a simple plan but implementation was not simple. After three hours we finnaly made it, and we were so proud about it. We also did some pictures so later we created the animations from them. Working with this group was a good experience. You can see our final production from the link below.</h5>

        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <h5>The final stage of assigment was a presentation. Each group created a small space for
            presentation. We also created a space to present our work. I created the poster to hang in on the wall, so people will know about what movie we created our Interactive Production. Unfortunately when I arrived at printing station it was closed. Luckly Nina created a graffiti with a title of our movie. If u missed our presentation we also prepared a PDF with process of creating the production. </h5>
