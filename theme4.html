        <h2>How it went</h2>
        <h5> The goal - "Make the students life easier". This time I was working with a group to reach it. We did a brainstorm. We came up with our ideas and started to work. Based on an existing platform, which is "Fronter", we did some modifications. We implemented a lot of new feauters. We created one platform that has different platforms helpful for a student. All in one. We combined Fronter where the user can find all the information for students, Printing website, Slack which is a communicator, and a library website. We have also focused on the future of the students. We designe a place where students can upload their portfolios. By doing that we also created access to them for companies. Companies on that platform can easly seek for their future employees. In that project I was responsible for redesigning the logo of Fronter and for all of the visual cotent. I also helped a little with XD prototype. I think it was the best project so far. Working with a group was really fun. </h5>
