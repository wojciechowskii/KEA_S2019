        <h2>How it went</h2>
        <h5> The goal - "Make the students life easier". This time I was working with a group to reach it. We did a brainstorm. We came with ideas and started to work. Based on existing platform which is "Fronter" we did some modifications. We implemented a lot of feauters. We created one platform that has all different platforms that a student need. All in one. We combined together Fronter where all the informations are for students, Printing website, Slack which is a communcator and a library website. We also focused on the future of the students. We crated a place where students can upload their portfolio. By doing that we also created access for companies. Companies on that platform can easly seek for future employes. In that project I was mostly responsible for redesigning the logo of the fronter and all the visual cotent. I also helped a little with XD prototype. I think it was the best project so far. Working with a group was really fun. </h5>
